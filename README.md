## Introduction

This repository is the first project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team.

RealEstateAI Solutions aims to optimize real estate price valuation through the use of advanced regularization techniques in linear regression models. The goal is to provide more accurate and reliable price forecasts, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the model. In the real estate industry, obtaining accurate property price estimates is crucial to make informed decisions. However, traditional linear regression models can suffer from overfitting, compromising the accuracy of the forecasts. Effective regularization methods need to be explored to improve the predictive performance and manage the complexity of the model. By implementing and comparing regularization methods such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, RealEstateAI Solutions will offer a system capable of providing more accurate and stable real estate price forecasts. This will allow real estate agents and investors to make decisions based on more reliable data, increasing their competitiveness in the market.

Project Steps:
- Dataset Preprocessing
- Implementation of Regression Models with Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net regularization
- Performance Evaluation in cross-validation techniques:
- Use of cross-validation techniques.
- Visualization of Results

## Dataset

The dataset is structured in such a way as to emphasize the complexity due to the strong multicollinearity of the features. The dataset has 13 features and 545 samples and here there is a description of the features:
- Price: the price, the target to be predicted
- Area: surface area of ​​the property
- Bedrooms: number of bedrooms
- Bathrooms: number of bathrooms
- Stories: number of floors
- Mainroad: is 1 if the property overlooks a main road, 0 otherwise
- guestroom: is 1 if the property has a guest room, 0 otherwise
- basement: is 1 if the property has a basement, 0 otherwise
- hotwaterheating: is 1 if the property has a boiler, 0 otherwise
- airconditioning: is 1 if the property has air conditioning, 0 otherwise
- parking: number of parking spaces
- prefarea: is 1 if the property is in a prestigious area, 0 otherwise
- Furnishingstatus: is 0 if the property is unfurnished, 1 if it is partially furnished, 2 if it is fully furnished
